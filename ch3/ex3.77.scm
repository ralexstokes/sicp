;; Exercise 3.77.  The integral procedure used above was analogous to the ``implicit'' definition of the infinite stream of integers in section 3.5.2. Alternatively, we can give a definition of integral that is more like integers-starting-from (also in section 3.5.2):
;;
;; (define (integral integrand initial-value dt)
;;   (cons-stream initial-value
;;                (if (stream-null? integrand)
;;                    the-empty-stream
;;                    (integral (stream-cdr integrand)
;;                              (+ (* dt (stream-car integrand))
;;                                 initial-value)
;;                              dt))))
;;
;; When used in systems with loops, this procedure has the same problem as does our original version of integral. Modify the procedure so that it expects the integrand as a delayed argument and hence can be used in the solve procedure shown above.

(define (integral delayed-integrand initial-value dt)
    (cons-stream initial-value
                 (let ((integrand (force delayed-integrand)))
                   (if (stream-null? integrand)
                       the-empty-stream
                       (integral (delay (stream-cdr integrand))
                                 (+ (* dt (stream-car integrand))
                                    initial-value)
